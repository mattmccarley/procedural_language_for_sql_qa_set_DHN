# Question 2

## Prompt
```
What is a cursor in procedural languages for SQL, and what is its primary purpose in interacting with database tables?
```

## Answers

- Definition: A cursor is a database object that acts as a pointer to a result set of a SELECT statement, allowing row-by-row processing of the retrieved data.
- Primary purpose: Cursors enable procedural code to iterate through and manipulate individual rows returned by a query, facilitating operations that require row-level processing or complex data manipulations not easily achieved with set-based SQL operations.

## Prompt
```
What is a stored procedure in procedural languages for SQL, and how does it differ from a regular SQL query in terms of functionality?
```

## Answers

- Definition: A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements and procedural logic stored in the database and executed as a single unit.
- Differences from regular SQL queries:
- Stored procedures can contain complex logic, loops, and conditional statements, while regular SQL queries are typically single statements or simple combinations of statements.
- Stored procedures can accept input parameters and return output parameters or result sets, whereas regular queries typically only return result sets.
- Stored procedures are compiled and stored in the database, offering better performance for repeated executions, while regular queries are parsed and optimized each time they are run.
- Stored procedures can encapsulate and hide complex business logic, providing a layer of abstraction and security, while regular queries are often exposed directly in application code.
